# Issues

## How are fixed issues implemented

There aren't supported or unsupported versions, when you report any issue, whatever the version is, it will be fixed and implemented in the next version that comes out.
This means that you can use any version of the mod, but any bugs that you might find will be fixed for the latest version,
so I encourage you to play with the latest version available, not only because it's the one that has more content, but also because it's the most stable one that you can play with.

## Reporting an issue

If you find any bugs, problems, typos, or you want to suggest anything that can be added for the mod, please tell me using the 'Issues' section, located in the top part of GitHub,
just below the repository name and next to the sections 'Code' and 'Pull requests'. You can start a new issue or vote for the ones that you would like to be on the mod.
To create a new issue (please, always make sure that your issue hasn't been started yet), just click on 'New Issue', then add a title and describe your problem or suggestion
below, and finally click on 'Submit new issue'.

Thanks everyone for your colaboration
